# Caspar Coding Assignment

Thank you for taking your time to compete our coding task. Our goal is to see how you navigate and tackle things in the existing codebase rather than building something from scratch. 

## Given:

-   A subset of our app with a piece of functionality that presents a list of exercises with the ability to open an exercise details page.

-   The project is far from perfect and has some obvious (and some not so obvious) flaws.

-   Network responses are mocked to retrieve the response from json files (included in the project).


## Desired outcome:

1.  Publish the initial repo somewhere we would be able to get access to.

2.  Create a feature branch.

3.  Fix the runtime error triggered on an exercise cell tap.

4.  Complete the setupExercises method in ExercisesListViewController class.

5.  Address anything that you feel like it needs to be.

6.  Commit your changes to the feature branch.

7.  Submit a pull request to the main branch with the description of what was done.


## Things to keep in mind:

-   Treat this task as it was your first assignment on the new job.

-   Stay in the scope of the task, consider the task to be put among the others tasks in the sprint, and if the task “blows up“ please consider certain measures to be taken to still accomplish the sprint goal.

-   Refactoring of adjacent code areas is acceptable as long it is related to the task and doesn't cause a significant scope increase.

## Questions or feedback?

Don't hesitate to reach out if something is inclear, we are happy to improve.
